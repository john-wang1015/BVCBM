This repo is a Python package wrapped the C++ implementation for following papers:
- [Calibration of agent based models for monophasic and biphasic tumour growth using approximate Bayesian computation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-024-02045-4)

Agent-based models are a class of models that can describe complicated phenomena by analysing the interactions between each agent. In cellular dynamics, treating each cell as an agent is a popular strategy. Prior research has sometimesÂ ignored the geometries of agents and only considered their interactions. In the Voronoi cell-based model, the agent is modelled with Voronoi tesselation so that its shape is as accurate as reality.

## How to Install

You can use following line of code to install the BVCBM via `pip`:

```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/john-wang1015/BVCBM.git
```

## How to Use

After successfully installed, you can use following code to import the model:

```python
import bvcbm
```

For use VCBM, you can use this `full_simulation`:

``` python
  volumes = bvcbm.full_simulation(
    p0=0.3,
    psc=0.1,
    dmax=150,
    gage=24,
    page=12,
    start_volume=1.0,
    simtime=30,
)

print(volumes)
```

and for BVCBM, you can use `full_simulation_biphasic`:
```python
volumes_biphasic = bvcbm.full_simulation_biphasic(
    p0_1=0.3, psc_1=0.1, dmax_1=150, gage_1=24, page=12,
    p0_2=0.2, psc_2=0.05, dmax_2=150, gage_2=24,
    tau=10.0,
    start_volume=1.0,
    simtime=30,
)

print(volumes)
```

All the parameters values can be user-defined and we recommend to use flat prior if you need to make inference.
